# ILP-last-mile-delivery


A logistics company operates with a main **Service Center (SC)** and a network of **n delivery nodes** (or *delivery cells*) to manage the last mile.

The task is to plan the delivery of **M packages**.

For each package, the company must make a strategic decision:  
Should it be assigned to the route of a vehicle that departs directly from the SC, or should it first be sent to a delivery node so that the node manages the final delivery?

The objective is to **minimize the total delivery cost of all packages**, while respecting the operational capacity constraints of each node.
